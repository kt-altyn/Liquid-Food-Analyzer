# INTRODUCTION
Liquid food analysis is the process of analyzing the composition and quality of liquid foods such as milk, fruit juices, and soups. This analysis can be conducted for a variety of purposes, including ensuring the safety and quality of the food, identifying any potential contaminants or adulterants, and determining the nutritional content of the food. Analyzing the physical, chemical, and biological properties of liquid foods can provide valuable information about the food's suitability for consumption and its shelf life. There are various techniques used in liquid food analysis, including spectroscopy, chromatography, and microscopy, which can be used to identify and quantify various components of the food. These techniques can be used to determine the presence of additives, preservatives, and other substances that may affect the quality and safety of the food.
Optical and capacitive sensors are commonly used in liquid food analysis to measure various physical and chemical properties of the food. Optical sensors utilize light to measure properties such as color, clarity, and pH, while capacitive sensors use electrical capacitance to measure properties such as moisture content and density.
Overall, the use of optical and capacitive sensors in liquid food analysis can provide valuable information about the quality and safety of the food, as well as its nutritional content and other properties.

These 3D printed components ensure optimal positioning, alignment, and stability, minimizing external interference and maximizing the precision of the liquid food analysis. The combination of sensors, the ESP32 microcontroller, and 3D printed components forms the foundation for an accurate and efficient liquid food analysis system.
### 1.1.1. Optical Sensors
Optical sensors can be used to analyze the color and clarity of a liquid food to determine its quality and suitability for consumption. For example, a liquid food with a yellow or brown color may indicate the presence of contaminants or oxidation, while a clear liquid may indicate that it is fresh and free of impurities.
### 1.1.2. Capacitive Sensors
Capacitive sensors can be used to measure the moisture content of a liquid food, which is important for determining its shelf life and stability. Higher moisture content can lead to spoilage and degradation of the food, while lower moisture content may indicate that the food is stale or has been improperly stored. Capacitive sensors can also be used to measure the density of a liquid food, which can provide information about its nutritional content and other properties.
